Better Security Approaches
Consider these alternatives:
1. Individual Credentials

Generate separate app passwords for each friend
Each gets their own limited WebDAV subfolder
You can revoke individual access

2. Read-Only Distribution

Use a public read-only link/folder for distribution
Handle updates through a more controlled method

3. Proper Software Distribution

Use GitHub releases, proper package managers, or established distribution channels
Implement signed updates with verification

4. API-Based Updates

Create a simple API endpoint that serves the latest version
No shared credentials needed

Your security instinct is spot-on - this current method essentially gives every friend admin-level access to your distribution system.
