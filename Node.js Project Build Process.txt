Hello, I am now using "npm run build" to build my project. How could you tell about my project?

Modifier
Based on the fact that you're using npm run build, I can infer several things about your project:

It's likely a Node.js/JavaScript project since npm (Node Package Manager) is the standard package manager for the Node.js ecosystem.

--- Common project types that use npm run build: ---

React applications (Create React App, Vite, or custom webpack setups)
Vue.js applications
Angular applications
Static site generators (Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt.js)
TypeScript projects that need compilation
Modern JavaScript projects using bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel
Electron desktop applications


--- The build process likely involves: ----

Bundling and minifying JavaScript/CSS files
Transpiling modern JavaScript or TypeScript to browser-compatible code
Optimizing assets (images, fonts, etc.)
Creating a production-ready version in a dist/ or build/ folder


--- To tell you more specifically about your project, I'd need additional information like: ---

What's in your package.json file (especially the scripts and dependencies)
Your project's folder structure
What framework or tools you're using
Any error messages or specific issues you're encountering
